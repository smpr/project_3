<b>Objective:</b><br/>
To create a full MERN stack application. 
<br/>
<b>Notes:</b><br/>
I started this application with the goal to eventually hook it up to a external API and be fully functional. Due to project requirements I had to create my own API and use it for my data. I used all of the same refrences and data for the external API for my API model and will be able to simply switch it over. This applications uses Mongo, Express, React, and Node together. 
<br/>
<b>My Struggles:</b><br/>
With my objective in mind, I was trying to grasp a better understanding of React in general and more specifically states and props. There were several roadblocks hit during designing that caused me to change the layout. 
<br/>
<b>Reach Goals:</b><br/>
I would love to add a filter option on the news source page and add the ability to save favorite articles.
